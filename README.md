### Implementation of Image Classification using CNN Model and Image-Processing

# Overview

This project aims to develop an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and image processing techniques. The dataset used for this project consists of different types of chest X-ray images, including normal chest X-rays, COVID-19 infected X-rays, viral pneumonia X-rays, and bacterial pneumonia X-rays. The CNN model is trained to classify the images into one of these categories.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a collection of chest X-ray images in different categories. The dataset consists of the following classes:

Normal: Chest X-rays from healthy individuals.
COVID-19: Chest X-rays of patients infected with COVID-19.
Pneumonia (Viral): Chest X-rays showing symptoms of viral pneumonia.
Pneumonia (Bacterial): Chest X-rays showing symptoms of bacterial pneumonia.

# Model Architecture

The image classification model is built using a CNN architecture. The CNN learns hierarchical features from the chest X-ray images and performs classification based on those features. The model can consist of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Techniques such as dropout and batch normalization can be employed to improve the model's performance.

# Image Processing

Before feeding the images into the CNN model, certain image processing techniques can be applied to enhance the quality and features of the images. Some common preprocessing steps for chest X-rays include:

Image resizing: Resizing the images to a consistent size to ensure compatibility with the CNN model.
Grayscale conversion: Converting the images to grayscale to reduce computational complexity.
Contrast enhancement: Enhancing the contrast of the images to improve visibility and feature extraction.
